One-on-ones are one of the most important rituals for managers and tech leads. Done well, they build trust, uncover blockers, and align on growth. Done poorly, they feel like status updates or wasted time. This guide covers how to run 1:1s that matter.

## Purpose of 1:1s

1:1s are for the **report**—their priorities, concerns, and development. They are not primarily for you to assign work or get status (that can happen, but the report should drive the agenda). Use them to listen, give feedback, remove obstacles, and support career growth. Consistency and psychological safety matter more than length.

## Frequency and Duration

Weekly 1:1s are standard for direct reports; 30–45 minutes is often enough. For senior or stable reports, biweekly can work if you have other touchpoints. Don't cancel unless truly unavoidable—canceling signals that the meeting isn't important. If you must reschedule, do it promptly and keep the commitment.

## Agenda and Ownership

The report should own the agenda. Send a short prompt before: "What do you want to cover? What's going well? What's blocking you?" You can add topics (feedback, projects, growth), but avoid monologues. Start with an open question: "What's on your mind?" or "What would be most useful to discuss today?"

## Taking Notes and Follow-Through

Take minimal notes (action items, commitments, themes). Share notes only if the report is comfortable. After the 1:1, do what you said you'd do—follow up on blockers, share resources, or schedule the next conversation. If you don't follow through, trust erodes.

## Tough Conversations

Use 1:1s for difficult topics (performance, behavior, fit) when you need a private, focused conversation. Be direct and kind; state the concern and the impact; invite a response. Don't save up feedback for the 1:1 if it's time-sensitive—but the 1:1 is the right place for longer or more sensitive discussions.

Effective 1:1s are a habit: consistent, report-driven, and followed by action. Invest in them and they become your strongest lever for team health and performance.
