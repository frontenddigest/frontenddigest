Stepping into a tech lead role is a significant shift. You're no longer judged solely on your code—you're responsible for the team's output, technical direction, and culture. The first 90 days set the tone. A structured approach—inspired by Michael Watkins' *The First 90 Days*—helps you build credibility, understand the system, and avoid common mistakes.

## Phase 1: Days 1–30 — Listen and Learn

Your primary job in the first month is to absorb. Resist the urge to impose solutions or "fix" things immediately. Premature changes can damage trust and miss important context.

### Understand the Codebase and Architecture

Spend time reading code, tracing flows, and understanding the architecture. Where are the pain points? What works well? Set up your environment, run tests, and deploy to staging. Get hands-on so you can speak from experience, not assumption.

### Map the Stakeholders

Identify who matters: your direct team, adjacent teams, product managers, and leadership. Schedule one-on-ones with each. Ask open-ended questions: What do you expect from me? What's working? What would you change? Take notes and listen more than you talk.

### Learn the History and Context

Every system has a history. Why was this architecture chosen? What failed before? What constraints (technical, organizational, timeline) drove past decisions? Understanding "why" prevents you from repeating mistakes or proposing solutions that have already been tried and rejected.

### Observe Team Dynamics

Attend standups, retros, and design discussions. Notice how decisions are made, who contributes, and where friction exists. Who are the informal leaders? Who needs more support? This informs how you'll eventually influence the team.

## Phase 2: Days 31–60 — Build Relationships and Quick Wins

With a baseline of understanding, you can now contribute more visibly. Focus on building trust and delivering small, high-impact improvements.

### Build Trust Through Consistency

Show up. Deliver on commitments. Be transparent about what you know and don't know. Admit mistakes quickly. Trust is built in small moments—reliable follow-through, clear communication, and fairness in how you treat people.

### Identify Quick Wins

Look for low-effort, high-visibility improvements: fix a nagging bug, improve a slow CI step, clarify documentation, or streamline a painful process. Quick wins demonstrate competence and create goodwill. Avoid large refactors or architectural changes—you still lack the context for those.

### Support Your Team

Unblock people. Pair with someone struggling. Advocate for tooling or time they need. Your success is now tied to theirs. When you help others succeed, you build loyalty and create capacity for bigger work later.

### Strengthen Cross-Team Connections

Continue building relationships with adjacent teams. Understand dependencies, integration points, and shared challenges. These connections pay off when you need alignment on technical decisions or cross-team initiatives.

## Phase 3: Days 61–90 — Set Direction

By the third month, you should have enough credibility and context to propose and drive change. This is when you start shaping technical direction.

### Articulate a Technical Vision

Based on what you've learned, draft a concise technical vision. What should the system look like in 6–12 months? What principles should guide decisions? Share this with your team and stakeholders. Invite feedback—it will improve the plan and build buy-in.

### Propose and Prioritize Initiatives

Translate the vision into concrete initiatives: tech debt paydown, migration steps, process improvements. Work with the team and product to prioritize. Make trade-offs explicit: if we do X, we won't do Y this quarter. Clear priorities reduce thrashing and set expectations.

### Establish Rituals and Practices

Introduce or refine rituals: architecture reviews, RFCs for significant changes, incident postmortems, or knowledge-sharing sessions. Start small—one new practice at a time—and iterate based on feedback.

### Empower the Team

Your goal is to make the team more effective, not to centralize all decisions. Delegate ownership of areas and support people in taking initiative. Create clarity on boundaries (what needs your input vs. what can be decided locally) so the team can move fast without constant escalation.

The first 90 days set the foundation for your effectiveness as a tech lead. Listen first, build trust through action, then lead with direction. Avoid the trap of changing everything at once—strategic, incremental progress beats dramatic overhauls that flame out. By day 90, you should have a clear picture of the landscape, strong relationships, and a plan the team can rally behind.
