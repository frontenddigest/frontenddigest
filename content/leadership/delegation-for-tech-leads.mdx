Delegation is how tech leads and managers multiply their impact. It frees you for higher-leverage work and develops your team. Poor delegation either leaves people unclear (and you redoing the work) or turns into micromanagement. This guide covers how to delegate effectively.

## What to Delegate

Delegate work that others can do well with clear context: implementation tasks, investigations, documentation, and well-scoped projects. Keep for yourself: decisions that set direction, sensitive people issues, and work that only you have the context for. Start with lower-risk, well-defined tasks and increase scope as trust and capability grow.

## Briefing Clearly

Set the outcome: what "done" looks like and why it matters. Share context and constraints (deadlines, dependencies, quality bar). Define boundaries: what they can decide alone vs. what they should check in on. Confirm understanding: "What's your plan?" or "What's the first thing you'll do?" Address gaps before they start.

## Check-Ins Without Micromanaging

Agree on check-in points (e.g. after design, at midpoint, before ship) rather than constant status asks. Use "How can I help?" and "What's blocking you?" instead of "Did you do X?" When they raise risks or blockers, help remove them; don't take over unless necessary. Review output at the end and give feedback so the next delegation is even smoother.

## Letting Go of Perfection

Delegated work may not match how you would have done it. If it meets the outcome and quality bar, accept different approaches. If it doesn't, give feedback and use it as a learning moment. Avoid taking back work at the first hitch—coach and unblock instead, so people grow and you don't become the bottleneck again.

## Building Ownership

When people own the outcome, they care more and learn more. Give credit publicly; hold them accountable for delivery. Over time, delegate not just tasks but areas of ownership (e.g. "You own the checkout experience") so they can make more decisions without you.

Good delegation is clear on the what and why, light-touch on the how, and consistent on follow-through. It scales you and grows your team.
