Meetings are expensive—they multiply with every attendee. Run them well and they align teams and unblock work. Run them poorly and they drain time and morale. This guide covers how to run meetings that are worth having.

## Do You Need a Meeting?

Many topics can be handled async: status updates (send a written update), simple decisions (Slack or doc with approval), or one-way info (record a short video or write a doc). Call a meeting when you need real-time discussion, alignment, or decisions that benefit from live debate. Default to "no meeting" and add one only when the cost is justified.

## Agenda and Outcomes

Send an agenda before the meeting: what you'll cover and what you want to achieve (e.g. "Decide: approach A or B"). Allocate time per topic so you don't run over. Start on time; don't wait for stragglers (they'll learn). End with clear next steps and owners.

## Timeboxing and Facilitation

Stick to the timebox. When a topic is running long, say "We have 5 minutes left—let's decide or park this." As the host, facilitate: invite quiet people in, cut off tangents, and summarize decisions. If you're the one presenting, leave time for questions and don't over-pack the deck.

## Async Alternatives

Consider async-first options: Loom for short updates, written RFCs with comments for design decisions, or a shared doc that people edit before a short sync. Reserve live meetings for the pieces that truly need real-time interaction.

## After the Meeting

Send a short summary: decisions made, action items, and owners. If someone couldn't attend, they should get the same summary. If there were no decisions or actions, question whether the meeting was necessary next time.

Effective meetings have a clear purpose, a tight agenda, and concrete outcomes. Default to async; when you meet, make it count.
