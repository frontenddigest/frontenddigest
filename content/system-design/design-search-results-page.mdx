A search results page is a core pattern in e-commerce, content sites, and dashboards. It combines query input, result list, filters, sorting, and often facets. Here's how to structure your answer in an interview.

## Requirements Clarification

**Functional:** Display results for a query; support filters (category, price range, etc.) and sort options (relevance, date, price); show facets or filter counts; load more via pagination or infinite scroll. **Non-functional:** Fast first result (e.g. &lt; 1.5s), SEO-friendly URLs for key filters, accessible filters and result list.

## High-Level Architecture

SearchPage contains: SearchInput (debounced), FilterSidebar (facets, applied filters), SortDropdown, ResultList (virtualized if large), and Pagination or infinite scroll sentinel. State: query, filters, sort, page/cursor; sync with URL (query params) for shareability and SEO.

## API Design

GET /search?q=...&filters=...&sort=...&page=... or cursor-based. Response: results array, total count (or approximate), facet counts per filter. Use debouncing (e.g. 300ms) on query input; consider prefetching or caching popular queries.

## Filters and Facets

Facets are the distinct values and counts per filter dimension (e.g. "Category: Electronics (120), Books (80)"). Backend returns them with the result set. Frontend applies selected filters to the next request; show applied filters as chips with clear action. Avoid filter combinations that return zero results—either disable or show "no results" with clear CTA to reset.

## Pagination vs Infinite Scroll

Pagination is better for SEO, deep linking, and keyboard users. Infinite scroll is better for mobile and discovery. Hybrid: "Load more" button that appends results. Preserve scroll position when navigating back. For very long sessions, consider virtualizing the list.

## Performance and Accessibility

Virtualize long lists; lazy-load images in results. Ensure focus management when filters change and results update. Use semantic list and headings; announce result count to screen readers. Loading and empty states must be clear and accessible.

A well-designed search results page balances power (filters, sort) with simplicity, keeps URL in sync, and stays fast and accessible.
